          <h3>How To Make Low Carb Chicken Stew</h3>
          <p>
            This chicken stew recipe starts with chicken thighs, because they
            have way more flavor than chicken breasts and won’t dry out as easy.
            Season the chicken thighs with a good pinch of salt and then the
            Moroccan spice rub which has smoked paprika, cinnamon, cloves,
            coriander, and more. Once the spices sear into the crust in a hot
            cast iron pan, the flavors will be off the charts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remove the seared chicken from the pan and cook the onions and
            zucchini in a shot of avocado oil for 7 minutes. All of the veggies
            are perfect for a low carb keto diet and will add massive flavor to
            the chicken stew. Add the green olives, roasted red peppers,
            reserved chicken and the juices, chicken stock, and lemon slices.
            Simmer everything on low for 30 minutes or until the liquid has
            reduced by half, and make sure to check for seasoning after 20
            minutes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Allow the chicken stew to rest on the side while you make the
            cauliflower rice. The recipe makes enough for 5 servings of keto
            meal prep for the week.

          <h3>How To Cook Cauliflower Rice</h3>
          <p>
            This is hands down my favorite recipe I have ever made for
            cauliflower rice. Start off by cooking some onions in a a shot of
            avocado oil and then added garlic, grated ginger, and 1 tablespoon
            of ground turmeric. The turmeric is what makes this keto cauliflower
            rice golden in color. Next add 1 cup of full fat coconut milk and
            watch the color immediately turn yellow
          </p>

          <p>
            Once the milk has reduced by half, added the freshly grated
            cauliflower rice, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and cook for 3-6 minutes
            until the cauliflower is cooked through, but not soggy. Finish the
            cauliflower rice with lime zest, sliced red chilies, unsweetened
            coconut flakes, and fresh herbs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Resist the urge to buy pre-made cauliflower rice from the store,
            especially frozen cauliflower rice, as the texture is too soggy. All
            you need to do is grate a head of cauliflower on the largest setting
            of a box grater. This will give you the ideal texture for the
            cauliflower rice, and you will avoid paying for a bag of shredded
            stalks, which is what they sell at the store.
